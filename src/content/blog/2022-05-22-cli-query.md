Salesforce provides the force:data:soql:query command.  This command lacks
support for running a SOQL query saved in a file.  The Salesforce
command supports the -q option which allows the user to specify the query
on the command line.  Specifying a query on the command line becomes tedious and
error prone as queries grow larger and more complex.  Such long queries are frequently stored in multiline shell variables.

Given the query:

```SQL
SELECT 
    Id, 
    Name,
    Owner.Profile.Name,
    (SELECT Id, Name, Owner.Profile.Name FROM Contacts)
FROM Account
ORDER BY Name
LIMIT 10

```

The @pogilvie/dx plugin allows running the query as a single line:

```Makefile
query:
	sfdx pogilvie:query:soql -f ./scripts/soql/Account.soql -u mockdata 
```

As opposed to the Salesforce query command below, where multiple escapes are required for the multiline string:

```Makefile
query = "\
SELECT \
    Id, \
    Name, \
    Owner.Profile.Name, \
    (SELECT Id, Name, Owner.Profile.Name FROM Contacts) \
FROM Account \
ORDER BY Name \
LIMIT 10"

query-inline:
	sfdx force:data:soql:query \
		-q $(query) \
		-u mockdata
```

## Installation
`sfdx plugins:install @pogilvie/dx`
